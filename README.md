✨ Three.js Object Highlighter Using Stencil Buffer
This project demonstrates how to implement object selection and highlighting using the stencil buffer technique in Three.js. When a user clicks on a 3D object in the scene, it gets highlighted with a green outline! 🟢

🚀 Features
🖱️ Interactive 3D Scene: Contains 6 different objects (cube, sphere, cone, torus, cylinder, and dodecahedron) on a ground plane.

🎯 Object Selection: Uses raycasting to detect which object is clicked.

🖍️ Stencil Buffer Highlighting: Implements a proper stencil buffer technique for clean object outlining.

🔄 OrbitControls: Allows for intuitive navigation (rotation, pan, zoom).

🌑 Shadow Rendering: Objects cast and receive shadows for visual depth.

🔧 How The Stencil Buffer Technique Works
The stencil buffer technique is used to create outline effects around selected objects. Here's how it works:

🎯 Object Selection: When a user clicks on an object, it is identified using raycasting.

🖍️ Outline Creation: A slightly larger copy of the selected object is created with a semi-transparent outline material.

🖥️ Stencil Buffer Rendering Process:

The scene is rendered normally.

The stencil buffer is cleared.

The selected object is rendered to the stencil buffer only (not to the color buffer).

The outline mesh is rendered with a stencil test that only draws where the stencil value doesn’t match.

This creates a clean outline effect around the selected object!

⚡ How to Run
📥 Clone this repository

🌐 Open index.html in a web browser

🖱️ Click on any object to select it and see the outline effect

🔄 Click on another object to change the selection

🖱️ Use the mouse to navigate:

Left click + drag: Rotate the camera 🔄

Right click + drag: Pan the camera ↔️

Scroll: Zoom in/out 🔍

🔍 Technical Implementation Details
🎨 Renderer Configuration: WebGL renderer with stencil buffer enabled.

✏️ Stencil Operations: Uses THREE.AlwaysStencilFunc and THREE.NotEqualStencilFunc for proper mask creation.

🛠️ Material Handling: Temporarily swaps materials during the stencil buffer writing phase.

📐 Geometry Cloning: Creates outline geometries that match the original object but slightly larger.
